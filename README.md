### Introduction

**cargo** is a library that provides a powerful way of handling objects and 
 their dependencies, by using the *Container*. The container works
 by implementing the [Dependency Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) 
 pattern via constructor injection, resulting in explicit dependencies and the achievement 
 of the [Inversion of Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) principle.
